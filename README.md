# GUASFCU Saver Service [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kmalhotra13/GUASFCU-Saver-Service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kmalhotra13/GUASFCU-Saver-Service)

The purpose of this service is to automate savings for college students who might not have the ability to save by traditional means. The main service currently deployed is the Round Up Saver Tool.

The tool functions via its remote server deployment, and every 10 minutes it gathers all new debit card transactions made out of the linked account. From there, the service aggregates the Penny value of the difference between each transaction amount and the next dollar, and deposits that value into savings.

Through this methodology, for every cup of coffee you buy at $2.25, you will save $0.75.

## Technical Prerequisites

<b>Software Requirements</b>
- Git
- Anaconda 3.7
- Python 3.7
- Pip
- Packages listed in `/requirements.txt`

<b>Hardware Requirements</b>

The software should be installed on a personal computer and a Heroku application server or other production server with the capability to continuously execute the Python scrips on an inteval (suggested: 10 minutes)

<b>Network Requirements</b>

The service requires an internet connection to connect to and communicate data through the GUASFCU, Narmi, and Twilio API services, all over HTTPS protocol.

## Banking Prerequisites

In order to utilize this service, you must have an online account with GUASFCU. You can create this account by signing up at [www.guasfcu.com](https://online.guasfcu.com/login).

You must also have obtained an API key from GUASFCU. This key can be obtained by signing up with [Narmi](https://www.narmi.com/developers/guides/).

After you have received your token and secret, update the contents of the ".env" file to specify these values as environment variables called `token` and `secret`, respectively.


### SMS Prerequisities

For SMS capabilities, [sign up for a Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio), click the link in a confirmation email to verify your account, then confirm a code sent to your phone to enable 2FA.

Then [create a new project](https://www.twilio.com/console/projects/create) with "Programmable SMS" capabilities. And from the console, view that project's Account SID and Auth Token. Update the contents of the ".env" file to specify these values as environment variables called `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, respectively.

You'll also need to [obtain a Twilio phone number](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/getting-started/build) to send the messages from. After doing so, update the contents of the ".env" file to specify this value (including the plus sign at the beginning) as an environment variable called `SENDER_SMS`.

Finally, set an environment variable called `RECIPIENT_SMS` to specify the recipient's phone number (including the plus sign at the beginning).

## Installation

In order to set up this applet, please download install the source code:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:kmalhotra/GUASFCU-Saver-Service
cd GUASFCU-Saver-Service/
```

Install the package dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From there, you'll need to obtain your account IDs for the account you have connected to your debit card (traditionally the checking account) and the account you want the money to be saved into (traditionally the savings account). To do so, run the following shell script, substituting in your Narmi token and secret:

```sh
token='XXXX'
secret='YYYY'

date=`date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'`

signature=`echo -n "date: $date" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -hmac "$secret" | base64`

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H "Date: $date" -H "Signature: keyId=\"$token\",algorithm=\"hmac-sha256\",headers=\"date\",signature=\"$signature\"" 'https://api.demo.narmitech.com/v1/accounts/'
```

then from the JSON response, copy the account ID for the checking account into your .env file as the `FROM_ACCT_ID` and the account ID for your savings account as the `TO_ACCT_ID`. A sample response can be found at /Sample_Accounts_Response.txt. You're looking to take the "id" filed of the accounts portion of the response.

Create the last_tranID.txt file:

1. Create a file under the storage folder entitled 'last_tranID.txt' â€” the file path should be as follows `storage/last_tranID.txt`
2. Run the following script, and obtain the transaction ID for the first transaction (the most recent) that is obtained. A sample response can be found at /Sample_Transactions_Response.txt Make sure to substitute in your token, secret, and FROM_ACCT_ID:

```sh
token='XXXX'
secret='YYYY'

date=`date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'`

signature=`echo -n "date: $date" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -hmac "$secret" | base64`

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H "Date: $date" -H "Signature: keyId=\"$token\",algorithm=\"hmac-sha256\",headers=\"date\",signature=\"$signature\"" 'https://api.guasfcu.com/v1/accounts/FROM_ACCT_ID/transactions/''
```

3. Paste that transaction ID into the last_tranID.txt file, without any other characters. See the storage/last_tranID_example.txt for more information.

## Usage

Before using the script, verify the following are set up:
- Your .env file containing environment variables for:
	- Narmi Banking API Token
	- Narmi Banking API Secret Key
	- Online Banking API base URL
	- Checking Account ID
	- Savings Account ID
	- Twilio Account SID
	- Twilio Auth Token
	- Sender Phone Number
	- Recipient Phone Number
- Your storage/last_tranID.txt File containing solely the transaction ID for the last transaction made on your debit card
- All of the software and hardware prerequisites and the requirements.txt file installed.

You're ready to go! If you're running the script locally, ensure that you're in the correct directory (run the following):

```sh
cd GUASFCU-Saver-Service/
```

From there, to run the script a single time, run the following command:

```sh
python apps/round_up_saver.py
```

If you are hoping to deploy the script to a remote server, ensure that the same set up is done, and then schedule that script to run as often as you would like. I would recommend every 10 minutes or so, as that will capture debit card transactions very frequently, though you can do this as often as you'd like.
